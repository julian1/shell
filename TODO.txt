grid -> pushed into grid editor
	 -> pushed into presentation/rendering service with projection and style properties.
	 -> style properties pushed into a service to handle that.	
	 -> pushed into a lifetime manager. (not sure) 

when the grid notifies, everything can get updated. 

-----

done - Get rid of ref counting altogether. 




there's also no reason layers should be ref counted 

get rid of updateParms in the renderer - it's not the place

get rid of ptr< Layers>   it's ridiculous .  

	VERY IMPORTANT - if something needs pre_render() and po	st_render()
		like labelling etc.
	then it can create a dummy render job .  		
		- it's almost certainly related to rendering anyway.
				

	if it's dynamic then there should only be a single real reference for it  
	- and it should be being pushed

	- If something needs a pre-render pass then it can just be put
			on the render_job	
	

dynamic objects should rely on add() remove() when they pass themselves 
around.

- we should combine the area and the z_order to indicate that we retrieve both
	at the same time.

- get rid of modal control. 
	a subsystem can expose object to allow it to coexist peacefully with other subsystems
	when a subsystem decides it's working with an object i think it should take 
		control of events - eg. cancelling propegation or something.

- even if we rely on the create() functions rather than pimpl, they shouldn't return ptr<T
	> instead ptr<> should just be used in main() to avoid having to call destructors.

- get rid of the paramsUpdate. if something wants timer events it can get them from the
	timer interface.  

- refactor the renderer not to use ptr<>. this means that it's no longer responsible
	for keeping objects alive!!

- subsystems should never has responsibility for memory managing stuff, which should
	be done on the peer.

- should never be static functions . operations like contouring should be classes 
	implementing interfaces - probably stateless. that way we can pass them down, 
	rather than editing source code deep.

change name of renderer to renderables to be consistent with labels and layers ? 

get rid of the reference counting on components.    except for layer... 




change name of layers to aggregate ... or else create these classes, that know how to add themselves to services.
	they have to have the services.

NOTE
Without the key. we can't easily remove an item fro the services, because we generally create wrappers. 
	this probably means that the add() and remove() functions probably have to be put on the objects themselves.
	or else the wrapper has to be instantiated at a higher level. 

	eg. layer = new Layer( Services, data, proj )		// create or deserialize
		layer.load()									// add itself into the system.... 

	But we don't want to maintain the reference. we want to remove it, via the references.  


Let's try to create proper layer classes that can be added and removed. 
	eg. should be able to access. from layers.  

done 
	change name of service add/remove functions to add/remove

done
	get rid of the keys in the renderer and labels and position editro.  and remove the key.h file.
		done for labels.

done
	ok, we should be splitting the updateable services (view orientated) with the non-updatable services, 
	that are usually pretty specific for a layer.   

	the terminology of the layer and layer_update() is not right, since we call these things aggregates 
		- actually it's kind of ok.
		- we might change the name of the aggregate to layer.

	change filename post to layer

	*** potentially make layer perform reference counting to keep alive.

done 
	now we want to get rid of the the projection service.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------
	change name of add_x_job() to just add_job for the different services. 
	
---
	EXTEREMELY IMPORTANT
		- We should have a subsystem, that can deliver an event for when the projection is about to change. 
		- This would be a much cleaner way, to suppress drawing on layers etc, during resizing etc. 
		- eg. don't register against the projection, instead have a dedicated interface for these operations (like the onion model of event propagation). 

-----
	Modal control should delegate events, if it preserves the concept of an active controller.

----
	I think pimpl can be done more easily and might be better. and we can get rid of add_ref()/release() for services.
	Where something 

--
	- We need a param controller as well. 
	- and drop down list for params, also for levels. 

	- also - it is quite simple to have the concept of active layer. and active cube.  
	- can have a dedicated list of all layers etc. 	
----
	EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
		stages can have their references or wrappers pushed out to subsystems eg.
			- a selector for metadata (grib, analysis )
			- an operation to smooth (gaussian blur) a grib

---
	try to get the validity working. and have a slider or something for retiming. and perhaps use platform separation of gtk code. also render support. 

---
	EXTREMELY IMPORTNAT
		- we don't need full blown update callbacks, to communicate from a controller to a gui platform controller eg. 
		for the gui to monitor the active item. a simple generic
		notification of state change is quite sufficient. (Like c#  ). 
		
		struct INotify
		{
			// void * is ok. Because we should already be maintaining the fully typed reference to the sender . 
			void update( void * sender ); 
		};     
		if( sender == cube )
		{
			// recalculate ...
		}
		if( sender == projection )
		{

		}

-- 
	how do we show the current level ? when an item is set to be active. another interface ?. and update() ?
---
	should we do a similar icube interface,  for the shapes. Probably. just enabling selection of different cubes 
		or label fields. !!!!.  Not sure, these are options ????. But it should be exposed through this type 
		of delegated indirection.
	
---
we can also easily propagate change dependencies. eg receit of new data, or a delta applied etc.
	because there is a clear pipeline. 

	we could even put the gts decoding inside the cube itself. YES. This should be done for test purposes . not in the command. 


	grib metadata, or sat can be applied and removed as we like. It is simple. it just needs to be treated separately from the Main criteria. 

---
	cube staging can be used for :-   (adding removing criterias)


	- validity interpolation.
	- adding of standard/expected levels, valids, even if data is missing. 
	- elaborating formula that can be calculated both hard and soft coded.	
	- osfm / deltas (eg rather than edit the grid. a cube stage, will maintain the deltas for validies and levels), and apply them as needed)
			- eg. need to change the interface, to enable this two way change.
			- this then propagates correctly to slices, or roaming teph, or point forcasts.  
	- application of vectors for 'now casting'. 
	- interpreting generic grib param code, to Param( "name", "unit" ) according to centre and origin.  soft (.txt tables) or hard coded 
	- slices, roaming teph, analysis, point forcasts can all be built of it. 
	- area combining (eg. for tiled gribs )
	- caching
	- unit conversion. eg. knots to mps, and f to degc. Easily inserted either before or/and after formua etc.  in fact it's pretty  
		easy to insert on both sides if it was required. eg to degF for display, but degC for formula.  
	- filtering of unneeded planes where we are not interested in the unit. 
	- caching operations
	- operations involving db loading, or from gts text file, etc. etc. 


	Note, the importance of dependency injection of code, rather than using textual configuation. code is Much more powerful 
		with execution context, and can delegate to a file if absolutely needed. 

	- what we are not clear on, are point data, like reports. But they could probably be squashed into the scheme.

----
	EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
		- grib param code conversion, can also be handled in the cube.  
		eg. From the generic grid id. to a param and unit string, according to origin and centre.
		- it doesn't have to be performed in the grib decoder. and can make the stages modular. 	
		- can have an extremely customizable 

	- satellite can be feed through the same interface. 
	- and wind. 
	- and possibly point data (forcast, and obs )

----
	for formulas. it might be a lot easier. to hard code their availablilty. by eg. just looping validity and level. 
		struct DiffFormula
			matchtest( s, level, validity, meta )	
				if 
					level.type == hpa
					&& s.find( Criteria( param( "temp", "degc"), level, validity ) )  
					&& s.find( Criteria( param( "temp", "degc"), Level( level + 1), validity ))  ; 

				return
					SurfaceCriteria( param( "temp diff", "degc", level, validity )) ; 

			calculate( cube, level, validity )
				cube.get( "temp", level, validity ) etc ... 
			
		calculate_formula
			get all levels and validies ...
			then test the creation formulas ...
	

-----
	EXTREMLELY IMPORTANT. The actual application of a delta (to more than one level and validity), can be performed
		inside a stage of the icube as well. !!!.  eg. the vector is computed. and then applied for all requests
		for data.
		- then it correctly propagates to formulas as well as slices etc.

	- similarly units can be done through an icube stage.

	- it might be easier to treat parameter names and units as strings. eg. easier to match for formulas and stuff. 
		the unit can then be done with a string ??? and is meta.

	- we can have a flag on a parameter indicating whether it's editable.
	- the icube interface to get calculated formulas, could have a meta description for the data, which can be added or empty. 
---
	It might make sense for the global model, eg. wafc to have a uniquely identified ll projectoin. make it easier for clipping type stuff.

---
	it should be quite easy to interpolate in validity. we have a stage and if it sees something isn't validity aligned
		we interpolate it and return it. We don't have to expose that it's available in the criterias. Instead we just
		honor the request for the validity. 


----
	the transaction boundaries for editing - should really be placed on the cube.

	cube should wrap cube interface. eg. formulas, and interpolation for time, and combining of areas, and slices  etc.

	it just needs a get_criterias. and get_grid.  
---


	Why do we even need the grid_aggregate_root. ???
	Why not just inject the grid itself into the controllers and adaptors

		eg. the cube/ and cube wrapper is the central model.	

	or at least move it entirely within the grid_aggregate

---
done 
	level component interface - this covers everything we need for level control for cube model, or analysis, or single grib from db etc. 
		get_level()
		get_available_levels()
		get_standard_levels()


	Do not use tags in the surface criteria.
	**** Tags FORCE US TO USE and inherit from the generic Desc.  which is ugly because should be separate, in their tags. 
---
	We should change the surface_criteria to a specific grib_criteria, until we are certain about how it will o 
		- eg. be specific until we know otherwise

---

	- I think the fundamental interface of the cube. is that it can provide a list of everything it
	can calculate. but doesn't, unless specifically requested. that way it will work with analayis and formula etc.

---
	level stuff should be in level.h or level_desc.h to avoid having to associate crap.
		- remember the level_editor knows nothing about anything other than the level.
		- the matching of validity, is done in the adaptor wrapper.

--
	chnage name of surface.h to bitmap_surfae.h or just Renderable or bitmap_renderable.h    etc.
		- it's too confusing.

----
	making the level, would be nice, then we can display it, in the gui. 
		- note that separating out the gtk level editor view from the controller might be needed
		- We need a level type in a separate file. independent of anything else.  

----
	the cube needs to combine area. this should be done at cube level, so it can be shared as a model. 
		eg. import from grib. OSFM grid. then export as gribs.

	- we need a better abstraction, of the cube to support analysis etc.
	- also use of cube for roaming profile.
	- also secondary derived formula. 	

	ACTUALLY NO. We want separate Grib cube, versus Analysis cube. But loading and constructing into views is a composition job. 

	Not sure. At some point. They are quite separate. then  

	CubeAnalysis
	Formula( CubeAnalysis)
	LevelControl( CubeAnalys )
	View( Formula )

	etc. etc. 
---

	done	removed the gribs service
--
done. The big advantage  to having the view class, is 

	// we can remove the services ref from delegated to stuff (not always - but often)
	// and we can get rid of the key (the view is unique and becomes the key ). 
	// can remove the root aggregate,  because we don't require the is_dirty() reference

	// we were adding things to the post ss, just to keep ref alive, even though required no update . !!! 
		// eg.  For the positions adaptor  we don't even need to update it . but we were registering it to a ss
			to keep it alive. In fact it's not an adaptor at all, but a controller.  
		- eg. we can use the parent for lifetime control

	// it's not clear 

--------------
/*
	We want a view structure. for the grid. 

	- the input grid
	- the specific contourer
	- the contour values policy.
	- the callbacks from the contourer
	- the adaptors for  
	- the style policy eg. value = modulo %  20, thick line
	- perhaps meta stuff eg. change in validity or level. we don't care at the moment.

	- and get rid of the keys.	
	- these things ought to be able to be injected in. and delegated to.  eg. 
	- and all the state for the above
	- the grid can be injected in. eg. or factored to be a separate aggregate 
	- and possibly add the event sourcing (doesn't matter). 


	- it doesn't matter how we will ultimately sequence. We will work it out.	
*/

--------------

	- we should avoid having to maintain service references in the app as well as the services class. change to 
	use a ptr and then we don't care.  
	- the services class is not really DI as each service ought to be passed explicitly, but it is helpful to avoid
		having to pass too many dependencies when loading aggregates.

--
	isolines can work iwth boundaries and holes, just by expanding the size of the grid and setting the values
	to - infinity etc.

---
	we need commands that run against the application/ and services. to load gribs etc.

	remove the Surface from desc. Surface includes data, and is not generalized.    

--------------
- we need to be able to load a lot of gribs from a gts file. which means that the gts parsing code needs
to be put in a common place.  also the streaming and non-streaming frame decoding. if we have an interface
	for the extracted gribs, then this will enable constructing the pipeline a lot easier without doublehandling
	buffers etc ? 

// decoding a grib might be a common operation or decoding job. but loading from a gts dump file as a test, has to be 
// a command that can be run. 


- the grib decode and grib extract from gts are two separate operations, they really want to be kept separate.
	What about a generic decode gts. with pluggable decode_grib and decode_synop etc interfaces. and then we 
	can just fill in the grib one ??. 
	- the gts header could be passed to the interface, along
	- alternatively we have the gts decoders as common objects and just write a function to extract from gts. 

- there is a lot of confusion with test code, and tool code, doing similar stuff. it's hard to identify binaries
	in bin/linux etc.	



--------------------------

* add the logger to the services class, so that it's generally available

I feel sure The renderer/ blitter is not quite correct,   if every object and it's background
has to be blitted, in one go, then for isolines, this means a lot of huge squares.   
	- we have to check.

- We need to be able to draw each isoline (cheap), on a background surface and blit that.

- The easiest mechanism is probably to make drawing the isolines a single render job. such
that there is a single background.

- We need to take a measure of total area blitted through all operations.

-----------------------

* Use an IBlit interface to the renderer expose_update, because it will save copying
	into the temporary combine_buffer.

* done (but not for all services) Get rid of the IKey for renderer. Instead just insert the item and retain a strong reference. 
	we may want IKey for the update.preupdate, because many things will use this.

* create a new test renderer use two buffer system with gtk bounds intersecitons 
	(0) send list of invalide active regions
	(1) on receiving list back, copy the background for the regions to the active buffer 
	(2) draw the set of active objects
	(3) blit the regions to the gtk server. 

* get rid of ikey for some systems eg renderer. it simplifies no need for hashing, and
	no need for dynamic downcast. 
	perhaps some systems can still use the IKey where have to combine proj and agg. but
	other systems don't 

* done get rid of ui_events structs and use explicit method calls instead. we are just switching
	on them at the moment.  

* change ifdefs to pragmas, it is just so much more readable

* logger, timer to use interfaces, not self pointers. grid_editor, position_editor, projector same

* move in projection copied across from mingw3

* geometry clean. Ought to be able to be applied quite easily as a pass, just taking into
	account an active piece of geometry. should be placed in common, because its a
	atomic procedure.

* labels for contours

* add line style,  

* Use a wrapper around an aggregate, that delays propagation of invalid. For coupling
	models together.
 

* use an injected grid to widen the bounds, to avoid degenerate grid editing.

* VERY important. If the grid edit always works from the same grid when moving. then we
	should be able to precompute more things to handle the interpolation.
	should make more stateful.

* a section that's coupled with the surface

* use real data grib or  analysis 


* motion vectors. 

* postscript/pdf render, in a separate method.


Commercial 
	- Motion vectors applied to model and to analysis.
	- model edit and propagation. hydrostatic propagation.


	- the importance of the forcaster.

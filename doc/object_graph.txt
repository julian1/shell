The reason we currently do it is because we have a bunch of event handlers that
	are being caught on the application.

	As a matter of design. we really have to move these inside their own classes that are responsible
	for handling them.

why did we choose to make the application an object

rather than just assemble all the refs together in a big function ? 

a long function bringing everything together is clearer and simpler,
and can peform logic . 

remember construction is fundamentally different, from the objects that
talk to each other through references.

eg.

	A	a;
	B	b( a)
	C	c(a, b)
	c.run();

is very clear.

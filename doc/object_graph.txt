why did we choose to make the application an object

rather than just assemble all the refs together in a big function ? 

a long function bringing everything together is clearer and simpler,
and can peform logic . 

remember construction is fundamentally different, from the objects that
talk to each other through references.

eg.

	A	a;
	B	b( a)
	C	c(a, b)
	c.run();

is very clear.
